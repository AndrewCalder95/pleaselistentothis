Project Title 

PleaseListenToThis(working title)

Description 

A web application which allows music producers to share their music and have it reviewed/commented on by other users. To access these, however, the user must also listen to and do the same for the reviewer’s music. 


Why? 

I want to create an app based on a topic I find interesting and something I would find useful. In terms of tech, I want to create the backend in Java as I’ve had a chance to work with JS and Python for a big project and wanted to do the same with this language. As for the frontend, as Java doesn’t natively support this kind of thing (any more), I think React would be the best alternative. I also want to learn how to use authentication and plan to use Spring Security to do this. 


MVP Acceptance Criteria 

1. A working website that allows users to sign up/login, upload a link to their music (using soundcloud) and give other users the ability to listen to it and post comments about it.
2. The user should not be able to view a review of their track without having done the same for the reviewer’s track. 


Potential Extensions 

1. Ability to become ‘friends’ with other users and be notified when they do something i.e post a track
2. A discover page showing people who have the least engagement (to encourage people to listen to their music)
3. Be able to use youtube to upload music
4. Use new tech such as Semantic AI and Tailwind CSS
5. The ability to filter users by genre
